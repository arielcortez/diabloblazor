# DiabloBlazor
Based on the excellent [DiabloWeb](https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb) which, in turn, is based on the likewise excellent [Devilution](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution).

As the name implies, DiabloBlazor swaps out React used in DiabloWeb for Blazor, making it a double WebAssembly app: a WebAssembly (C#) OS installable PWA hosting a WebAssembly (C++) game. It also leverages TypeScript instead of JavaScript (except for the JavaScript glue code generated by Emscripten).

You can go to [DiabloBlazor on GitHub Pages](https://n-stefan.github.io/diabloblazor) to try it out.

The development server can be found here: [DiabloBlazorServer](https://github.com/n-stefan/diabloblazorserver).
