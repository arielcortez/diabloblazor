# DiabloBlazor
Based on the excellent [DiabloWeb](https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb) which, in turn, is based on the likewise excellent [Devilution](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution).

As the name implies, DiabloBlazor swaps out React used in DiabloWeb for Blazor, making it a double WebAssembly app: a WebAssembly SPA hosting a WebAssembly game. It also leverages TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

The server can be found here: [DiabloBlazorServer](https://github.com/n-stefan/diabloblazorserver).
